🐞 What is “Bug Fix in Production”?
    Production = the live version of your application that users are using.
👉 Bug fix in production means:
    Fixing a critical issue in the live application without breaking ongoing development.
🧠 Real-Life Analogy
         🚗 A car already running on the road
         Suddenly a brake issue is found
         You cannot redesign the car
         You must quickly fix only that issue
That quick fix = Hotfix
🔥 Key Rule (Very Important)
         ❌ Never fix production bugs on feature branches
         ❌ Never experiment on main
         ✅ Use a Hotfix branch
🌿 Branches Involved
        main        → Production (LIVE)
        develop     → Ongoing development (optional)
        hotfix-*    → Emergency bug fix
🚨 Scenario (Simple Example)
     App is live (main)
     Login fails for users ❌
     Developers are already working on new features
     You must fix login immediately
